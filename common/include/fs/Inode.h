/**
 * Inode
 *
 * All information needed by the filesystem to handle a file is included in a
 * data class called an inode. A filename is a casually assigned label that
 * can be changed, but the inode is unique to the file and remains the same
 * as long as the file exists.
 *
 * The path is through the inode hash table. Each inode is hashed (to an 8 bit
 * number) based on the address of the file-system's superblock and the inode
 * number. Inodes with the same hash value are then chained together in a
 * doubly linked list.
