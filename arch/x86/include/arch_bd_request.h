// \class BDRequest
// \brief Class containing command and parameters to pass to the BDManager.
// How to use:

// Create the BDRequest object with the proper parameters,
// pass the instance of that object to the pleaseProcessRequest 
// method of the BDManager and go to sleep.
// The calling thread will be awaken when the command is 
// processed. No timeouts are implemented so if there is some 
// communication error between the BDManager and the drivers,
// the thread will be sleeping for a looooong looong time.
// Possible solution is to implement timeout in sleep in 
// scheduler.
// The second option is to make a busy wait and check the
// getStatus() method.
// Look at the BD_CMD enum for the list of possible commands.
